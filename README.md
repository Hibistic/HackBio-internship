**Learning Track 4: Frontend Bioinformatics**

**Stage 0 (Writing)**

**Objective:** Data visualisation:

Author:Hiba

Data visualisation basically is a technique or can be called the tools that can help you to access complex structures in a very simple form and make it easy to understand for research purpose.By visualising data we can simplify our molecule to its most simplest form.

This would help to modify our data easily.In Bioinformatics we use different tools to simplify complex structures and align them in most easiest and simplest form for our work purpose.By visualising data you will be able to find different errors and mistakes that has been done in previous one.By visualisation you are more clear about the problems and easily accessible for solutions.such tools are always helpful in arranging the most complex structures,graphic data,statical data and analysing it for better version.

In bioinformatics it will help you to select, transform, and represent data in a visual form that allows humans to interact with the data in order to explore and understand it.

It will allow you to access a large amount of data at once and also help you to align and arrange it in a simple form for humans.you can retrieve large amounts of knowledge and can learn with the help of such tools to build your career in bioinformatics.

By the help of different visualisation tools you will be able to build a professional career in education.

Through such tools you can explore,analyse and synthesise a new network of your knowledge.it will build you broad and an informative person and also a professional network.

visualisation stages can be recognized: each requires a different strategy from the perspective of data relations and the need for interaction. These stages are

1.  Exploration

2.  Analysis

3. Synthesis

4. Alignment

Steps that are involved in data visualisation:

- Step 1 — Be clear on the question. ...

- Step 2 — Know your data and start with basic visualisations. ...

- Step 3 — Identify messages of the visualisation, and generate the most informative.

- Step 4 — Choose the right chart type. ...

- Step 5 — Use colour, size, scale, shapes and labels to direct attention 

The data which is analysed by the tools are different sequences,genomes,phylogenetic trees,genotype,phenotypes,and different human genes and proteins.these tools are accessed on computers,different informative technologies and super computers.

These tools make data in most arranged form for humans
